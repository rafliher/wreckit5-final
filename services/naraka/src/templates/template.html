      This page must to return My Name! In the eternal darkness of Hell lies a place known as the "Palace of Shadows." Here, Satan, the ruler of darkness, sits upon a throne of black obsidian, surrounded by blazing fire and suffocating smoke. On a night shrouded in mystery, as the blood moon casts its red light upon the underworld, Satan summons the demons for an important gathering. His piercing gaze sweeps over those present, greeting them with words that evoke fear and awe: "Welcome to the abyss of eternal power, where every decision you make shapes everlasting fate." Satan begins the meeting by emphasizing the crucial role the demons play in his grand scheme that will shake the world. Amid this terrifying address, every demon feels a deep sense of threat and challenge, as if standing on the brink of a great change. They know that each decision and action will create waves of chaos in the mortal world and have eternal consequences for their souls. With burning resolve and enveloped
      in fear, they prepare to receive their orders and face whatever lies ahead. After Satan's ominous welcome, the demons are commanded to begin the next phase of their grand plan. With a cunning smile, Satan directs them to undertake tasks filled with danger and challenge. "Now is the time to implement what we have planned," he declares, his voice resonating in the darkness. "You will spread despair and chaos in the human world, sending their souls into an endless labyrinth of darkness." The demons, each with their own goals and tactics, move within the shadows of the night. They enter the human world with deep-seated hatred and malice, corrupting and destroying everything they touch. With each step, they carry out Satan's orders with dedication and madness, leaving behind a trail of chaos and fear. Under Satan's guidance, they strive to execute the plan perfectly, building a bridge to deeper darkness and creating long-lasting effects that haunt. After a period of widespread chaos
      and darkness, Satan once again summons the demons to evaluate the results of their efforts. In a dark chamber filled with the scent of sulfur, Satan sits on his throne, reviewing the reports laid before him. "Let us review the results of your work," he says in a terrifying tone. "Have you met expectations and achieved the goals set forth?" One by one, the demons report their results, showcasing the impact of the chaos they unleashed. Satan listens intently, judging each report with a sharp and merciless gaze. Some demons succeed in meeting expectations, while others face his wrath and punishment. Through this evaluation, Satan decides the fate of each demon, offering praise to those who succeeded and punishment to those who failed. This process ensures that every action and decision carries clear consequences, reinforcing the hierarchy of power within the eternal darkness.</a
